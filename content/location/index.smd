Zigtoberfest 2026 is going to take place at the [Hoftheater München](https://hof.theater/), a non-profit corporate company.

You can reach the location from Munich Central Station in about 20 minutes by taking the subway line **U5** til **Schwanthalerhöhe** and then take the bus **53** and exit at **Sendlinger Kirche**.

One can find multiple cafe's and restaurants in the surrounding area.

Due to the location of the Hoftheater on the 1st floor without an elevator, we unfortunately cannot offer barrier-free access.

## What are the available food options for lunch?

While there are no food options directly available at the university, there are a bunch of options for having lunch near by.

## Can I bring my own food?

Of course!

## Is attending the conference really free?

Yes it is! The university provides the room(s) free of charge. In return we don't charge anything for the tickets.

## I can't make it. Is there a way to participate online?

Currently, it is not planned to live stream the talks but we'll record all talks and upload them to the [Zigtoberfest YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@zigtoberfest/videos).

## Can I park my car at the university?

It is recommended to get to the event location using public transport. If you have a electric car, there are two charging stations for electric cars directly in front of the building (Lothstra√üe 64).

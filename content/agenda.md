## Zine: a Static Site Generator Written in Zig

After years of using other SSGs I decided to write my own in Zig. In this talk I will showcase its most interesting features and what plans I have for the future.

## Approaches to Memory Mapped I/O

In embedded systems programming I/O devices are controlled through memory mapped registers - memory locations that act as messaging channels for the hardware peripherals. Different programming languages offer various tools and techniques to solve this deceptively simple problem. I'm going to explore and compare how languages like C, Rust and Zig fare in this aspect. 

### Speaker: Mattia Maldini

I'm an embedded systems developer from Bologna, Italy. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and almost 10 years of experience in the field. I'm also a enthusiast for everything that involves programming languages, from Logic to compilers. I've written a few [blog posts on Medium](https://medium.com/@maldus512).

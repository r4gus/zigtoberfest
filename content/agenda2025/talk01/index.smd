### I made the fastest image comparison library faster with zig

> *10:00 AM â€¢ Duration: 45 Min*

I'm the author of [odiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff) and recently I've rewritten it from scratch from the combination of OCaml and C to zig and improved the performance by 13-70% (13% though is much more correct to be honest lol) so just want to share my experience of highly SIMD oriented codebase with some inline assembly.

#### About Dmitriy

Just a software engineer working primarily in Rust and C but doing Zig for fun. Mostly work on images/audio/video related stuff and doing some assembly bullshit on twitter.

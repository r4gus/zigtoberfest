### Running your Company on the Command-Line with Zig, LaTeX, Git, and ZAPâš¡!

> *02:30 PM â€¢ Duration: 45 Min*

Once upon a time, many decades ago, I founded a company. Being a programmer, I
wrote a command-line tool to manage clients, and produce beautiful PDF offers,
invoices, and (FAX -- yes, THAT many decades ago ðŸ˜†) letters, using nothing but
`sed`, `awk`, `bash`, and `pdflatex`. Assigning incremental IDs on a per-year
basis, calculating taxes and the likes was all done with these basic
command-line tools. The results were beautiful but the software itself was so
brittle, that I wasn't even able to get it to work anymore, following my own
PDF-documented procedure, starting with its well-documented `init` command.

Now, many decades later, I am again founding my own company. And I still like
the charme of "running it on the command-line". This time, though, I wanted to
do it properly. So I wrote `fj -- The Commandline Company`, my `fjnance tool`
that's quickly accessible with both index fingers on the homerow of the keyboard
ðŸ˜Š, in Zig. It manages a private Git repository for all my clients, rates,
offers, letters, and invoices --- and lets me create these documents quickly,
editing billable items in my beloved NeoVim editor.

Once it became usable, I got tempted and added a `serve` command to it. So now I
have the option to even use it through the browser. And yayyy, do I love that
new dashboard! ðŸ˜Š

Along the way, I learned a lot of little things about building command-line
tools in Zig, then web-enabling them, from parsing command-line arguments, to
the joy of `noreturn`, to how hard it can seem to print its own version.

In this talk, I want to present my learning-journey, with `fj` as example.

#### About Rene

Hi, I'm Rene, also known as renerocksai. I love programming in Zig and do all sorts of stuff with it. I'm also in the lucky position to have been able to use Zig for both fun AND profit (aka "in my job") -- at the same time ðŸ˜Š yayyy -- for a few years now. I like sharing that joy in my talks.

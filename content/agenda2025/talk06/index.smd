### Send all your private data to ChatGPT

> *05:00 PM • Duration: 45 Min*

A couple of weeks ago, my cloud provider bill suddenly and unexpectedly went through the roof. To react quickly and figure out what was going on, I did what anyone would do in 2025: I sent the server logs to ChatGPT and asked it to analyze them and tell me what to do.

Of course, these logs contained a ton of private information that should never be shared with third parties, but whatever. Just before that, I had already used an MCP server to get insights about another service, using private data as well. So I was probably already on my way to hell.

Or maybe not.

In this talk, I’ll introduce techniques for using untrusted third-party services to analyze private information without ending up burning in hell.

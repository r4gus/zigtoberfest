I'm David, the organizer of the event.

We might have met at one of the [Software You Can Love conferences](https://softwareyoucan.love/) or you might have used one of my Zig projects:

- [PassKeeZ](https://github.com/Zig-Sec/PassKeeZ)
- [zbor](https://github.com/r4gus/zbor)
- [uuid-zig](https://github.com/r4gus/uuid-zig)
- [keylib](https://github.com/Zig-Sec/keylib)

I want Zigtoberfest to be a small but pleasant event for all attendees, regardless of your background, where you can socialize, share ideas and meet other people from the community. If you attend the event, don't be shy and say hi!

You can reach me on Discord or via email: zigtoberfest (at) thesugar.de

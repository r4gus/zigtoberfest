The Name Zigtoberfest is a combination of the words Zig (the programming language) and Oktoberfest, as the event takes place in Munich. It was coined by [Rene](https://renerocks.ai/) during a discussion on Discord.

# What is Zig?

[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software. Among other things, it offers a fresh approach to metaprogramming based on compile-time code execution and lazy evaluation. Zig can also be used as a zero-dependency, drop-in C/C++ compiler that supports cross-compilation out-of-the-box.
